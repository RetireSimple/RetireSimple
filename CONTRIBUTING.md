# Contribution Guidelines

RetireSimple was started and is currently used as a Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Capstone Project where senior students can demonstrate their cumulative experience and knowledge in a year-long project. As such, we have a few restrictions while students are working on the project.

## What we allow others to contribute

We accept the following types of contributions:

- Reporting Bugs, Requesting Features, or Suggesting Optimizations (to a certain degree)
- Submitting Bug Fix or Optimizations PRs
- Submitting Feature PRs that were either not previously planned or will not be a task for a student member to complete
- Constructive comments on student work (i.e. feedback on active, student-handled PRs/issues)
- Requesting/submitting a clarification on documentation

These contributions are subject to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We, the project owners also reserve the right to reject any contribution for any reason (we will usually provide a reason why).

Contributions related to security vulnerabilities (reporting, submitting fixes, etc.) show follow the guidelines outlined in the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) and are subject to those rules.

## What we do not allow others to contribute

To make explicit what we will not accept, we do not accept the following types of contributions:

- Feature PRs that are already planned to be completed by a student member
- Bug Fixes that are for a recently released student feature (we want them to practice fixing bugs)
- Criticism that are not constructive (i.e. "this is bad" or "this is wrong"); we will remove these comments and may block the user from contributing to the project as per the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

It should be noted that accidents happen and we will not punish users for making a mistake. We will usually provide a reason why we are rejecting a contribution. Commenting on a closed issue or PR is allowed and we will not remove these comments unless they violate the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
