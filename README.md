# RetireSimple

## Tools Needed

- Visual Studio with the ASP.NET, NodeJS, and Data Storage Workloads
  - VS Code can be used with the dotnet CLI + NodeJS separately, but the project is compiled as a VS Solution, which will become important when running builds
- MariaDB Server
  - We may use SQLite for single user, but this is still a good idea just in general
  
  ## Running
  
  - TODO Not far enough in the project to elaborate
  
  
  ## CI/Merging
  
  - TODO Make this eventually.
