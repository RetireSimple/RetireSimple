RetireSimple - User Instructions
========================================

1. Starting the Application
RetireSimple takes a different approach from other applications by effectively hosting its own server
that locally provides the interface of the application through a web browser. This allows us to easily
support both desktop use and a separate web version. This also allows RetireSimple to operate without communicating
on the Internet with other sources, ensuring a level of privacy. However, this application design choice
may be somewhat confusing initially on what it is doing.

To start RetireSimple:
1. Open the RetireSimple.Backend Executable (on Windows systems, you may see it as "RetireSimple.Backend.exe")
2. A console window will appear. This is the web server starting.
3. The web server will launch a new window/tab in your browser that opens to the RetireSimple Interface.
  a. If no browser launches but the web server is still running, you can open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:5000.

The web server console window can be minimized while using the browser interface, as it is intended to run in the background.


To close RetireSimple:
1. Close the browser window or tab that has the RetireSimple interface.
2. Find the console window created by the web server and close it.
